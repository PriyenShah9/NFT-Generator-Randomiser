# Welcome to the Boiler Blockchain NFT Minter

This project includes a React web app which interacts with an NFT-minting smart contract

### Instructions
To run locally, define your api and private keys in package.json, then use 'npx hardhat compile' and then 'npx hardhat node' to set up your local blockchain

Next, use 'npm start' to start the web app. Here, you can interact with the application to upload an image, connect your wallet, enter your email and discord, and mint your NFT.
